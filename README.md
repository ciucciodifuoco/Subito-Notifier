# Subito-Notifier
An handy script that alerts you when new items are being added on Subito.it based on your search query

USAGE

1) Go on Subito.it and search fo your item, you can also use all the search options that the site gives:
- Specific locations
- Price filtering
- Order filtering (most recent, price ascending, price descending)
- Custom search queries - add "-" to a word to exclude it or "" between two words to find the exact word order
Example: "Nintendo switch" -collector -controller -lite -giochi -gioco


2) Copy the resulting URL from your browser and run the script

~# python SubitoNotifier.py

3) Set an interval on how often the script should search for new items

4) Wait for BEEP notification


TBD: email notifications, multiple queries, a GUI that also displays images
